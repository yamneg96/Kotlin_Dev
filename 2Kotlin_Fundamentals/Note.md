# Data Types in Kotlin
* val (Immutable reference) - The variable declared using val keyword cannot be changed once the value is assigned. 
It is similar to final variable in Java.

* var (Mutable reference) - The variable declared using var keyword can be changed later in the program. 
It corresponds to regular Java variable.
Kotlin is a statically typed language like Java. That is, the type of a variable is known during the compile time. For example,

```val language: Int val marks = 12. ```

Here, the compiler knows that language is of type Int, and marks is of type Double before the compile time.

The built-in types in Kotlin can be categorized as:

* Numbers
* Characters
* Booleans
* Arrays

Number Type
Numbers in Kotlin are similar to Java. There are 6 built-in types representing numbers.

* Byte
* Short
