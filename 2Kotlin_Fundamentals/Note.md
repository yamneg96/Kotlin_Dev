# Data Types in Kotlin
* val (Immutable reference) - The variable declared using val keyword cannot be changed once the value is assigned. 
It is similar to final variable in Java.

* var (Mutable reference) - The variable declared using var keyword can be changed later in the program. 
It corresponds to regular Java variable.
Kotlin is a statically typed language like Java. That is, the type of a variable is known during the compile time. For example,

```val language: Int val marks = 12. ```

Here, the compiler knows that language is of type Int, and marks is of type Double before the compile time.

The built-in types in Kotlin can be categorized as:

* Numbers
* Characters
* Booleans
* Arrays

Number Type
Numbers in Kotlin are similar to Java. There are 6 built-in types representing numbers.

* Byte
* Short
* Int
* Long
* Float
* Double

## Type Conversion.
Here's a list of functions in Kotlin used for type conversion:

* toByte() 
* toShort()
* toInt()
* toLong()
* toFloat()
* toDouble()
* toChar()

Note, there is no conversion for Boolean types.
